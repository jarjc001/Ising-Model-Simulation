up to beta 0.4, the mag converge to 0, bu the time it takes to converse takes more time the higher the Beta


but at  beta and higher,it converses at lower M, eg 0. at m = -0.8 while 0.55 at m = -0.9
may be due to the prob (which is linked to beta/temp) is more likly to not flip than to flip 
(so the dipoles stay algined with neibours more likly, and causing Mag to be non zero)

from a 15000 sweep model for 0.44
at 10000 it looks like itll go to zero, but then goes back to down to -0.4
the greater the beta, the slower it takes to converge to 0 but also more it fulterattes around zero (zig zag around x axis)


i guess, all the beta converge to 0 up to 0.5 beta, (even for 0.43 up to 5000 sweeps)
