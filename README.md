"## Ising-Model-Simulation" 

Using a Metropolis Monte Carlo Simulation of the Ising model, the spin microstates of ferromagnetic
systems were studied. The speed at which the system reaches thermal equilibrium increased the closer
its temperature got it Curie Temperature. At thermal equilibrium, the system’s energy increased with
temperature. The system’s magnetisation was either ±1 at low temperatures or 0 at high temperatures,
with a dramatic phase transition when its temperature increased to its Curie temperature. The Mean
Field theory gave an accurate approximation for the Ising model’s magnetisation at low temperatures.
But did not exhibit the systems dramatic phase transition as the temperature approached the Curie
temperature, instead gradually transitions over a large temperature range. The magnetic susceptibility
of the Ising Model remained independent of temperature, until it approached the system’s Curie
temperature, where the susceptibility increased with temperature.
